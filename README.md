### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### Hello, I'm Honestly-nuts
I'm a Python, C, C++ programmer. I like programming. I don't have anything else to say really. Actually now that I think of it. I really fit 
into the stereotypical programmer personality. I am very lazy, I can't really talk to people even though I want to, I want to commit homicide.
Okay I'm joking about the homicide thing, **unless?!?** ðŸ˜¨.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Scuffed Utils, a python re implementation of GNU Core Utils](https://github.com/honestly-nuts/Scuffed-Utils), always be plugging.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, C, C++, javascript, Vim.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Command-line-tools, Gui's, Tui's, and more.
