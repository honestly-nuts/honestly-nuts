### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### Hello, I'm Honestly-nuts
I'm a Python, C, C++ programmer. I like programming. I don't have anything else to say really. Actually now that I think of it. I really fit 
into the stereotypical programmer personality. I am very lazy, I can't really talk to people even though I want to, I want to commit homicide.
Okay I'm joking about the homicide thing, **unless?!?** ðŸ˜¨.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Scuffed Utils, a python re implementation of GNU Core Utils](https://github.com/honestly-nuts/Scuffed-Utils), always be plugging.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, C, C++, Vim.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Command-line-tools and more.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with [Scuffed Utils](https://github.com/honestly-nuts/Scuffed-Utils) and [TPP, a Preprocessor for my project *gets hit by a bus*](https://github.com/honestly-nuts/TPP).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Anything accept Why I look Like shit.

- âš¡ Some *fun facts* about me:
  0. I use Vim (and NeoVim) as my text editor.
  1. I like to draw and sketch and design, I don't think I'm good at it but I like to do it any way. Here are some of my 
  creations (all of them are drawn with a mouse because I'm dirt poor) (beware: not all of them are serious) :
### Main logo for my project **gets run by a bus**:

### This one was my first ever attempt at raster drawing with a mouse (not a serious drawing):
